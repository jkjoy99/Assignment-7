            <h1>difference between Mape, filter, foreach, find</h1>
            <p>The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns
                undefined and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the
                returning value remains different.</p>

            <h1>difference between local storage and session storage cookies</h1>
            <p>Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts (10MB) of data to be stored, but
                the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data
                is only stored for the current session.</p>

            <h1>what does event loop do?</h1>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            <h1>Explaining quizTimer function</h1>
            <p>This is a JavaScript function named quizTimer that is responsible for running a countdown timer on a web
                page.

                Here is a breakdown of what the function does:

                It takes a single parameter named dismiss, which is used to stop the timer if it is truthy.

                If dismiss is truthy, the function clears an interval that is stored in a variable called timer. This
                interval is responsible for updating the timer display on the web page every second. The clearInterval()
                method cancels the interval and stops the timer.

                If dismiss is falsy, the function sets up an interval that runs every second. The interval function
                contains the code that updates the timer display on the web page.

                Within the interval function, the function gets a reference to an HTML element with an ID of "count".
                This element is used to display the countdown timer.

                The function then calculates the minutes and seconds remaining in the countdown based on the value of a
                variable called count. The count variable is incremented every second.

                The minutes and seconds are formatted as a string in the format "mm:ss" using conditional statements to
                add leading zeros where necessary.

                The formatted string is then inserted into the "count" element using the innerHTML property.

                If the count variable is greater than 60, the function alternates the color of the text in the "count"
                element every second to create a visual effect.

                The interval continues to run until the timer is dismissed by setting the dismiss parameter to a truthy
                value, at which point the clearInterval() method stops the timer.</p>

            <h1>Explaining ChoseQuize function</h1>
            <p>The function takes two parameters, index and givenAns. The index parameter is the index of the current
                question in the quiz and the givenAns parameter is the answer selected by the user for that question.

                The function first checks whether the current question already exists in the answers array. The answers
                array is an array of objects that stores the user's answers for each question.

                To check whether the current question exists in the answers array, the function uses the find method to
                search the answers array for an object that has the same id as the current question. The id is a
                property of the objects in both the quizData and answers arrays, which helps to match the question and
                its answer.

                If the current question already exists in the answers array, the function updates the answer for that
                question by iterating through the answers array using a for...of loop.

                The loop iterates over each object in the answers array, comparing its id property to the id property of
                the current question. When it finds a match, the function uses the splice method to replace the current
                object in the answers array with a new object that has the same properties as the current question
                object but with the givenAns property set to the givenAns parameter passed to the chooseQuiz function.
                The splice method is used to update the object in place without changing the length of the answers
                array.

                If the current question does not already exist in the answers array, the function adds a new object to
                the answers array using the push method. The new object has the same properties as the current question
                object but with the givenAns property set to the givenAns parameter passed to the chooseQuiz function.

                The function then calls another function named displayAnswers, passing in the answers array as an
                argument. The displayAnswers function is responsible for updating the UI to show the user's answers for
                each question in the quiz.</p>
